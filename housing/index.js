// the house starts paying people back to the tune of 1/2 thisYearRent every year.
// and then it pays back
// this has gotten complicated.
// the house can deal with old housemates as a lump.
// and so, totalOwed would be something like (tenant.owed * housemates)
// it would go up by {inflation} per year
// and go down by {thisYearRent / 2} per year.

// What is more to do?

// NARRATIVE FOR USE CASES

// BEFORE MORTGAGE PAID OFF
// for each year, if a tenant in tenants moved in after Year,
// add their "owed" for that year to debt. formula: (initialRent * (inflation**moveInYear) * 12)
// every year, adjust debt for inflation.
// 
// AFTER MORTGAGE PAID OFF
//
// for each year, rent goes *down* a little bit, reaching a minimum of... inflation-adjusted rent?
